# Terraform and AWS Workshop

## Introduction

This repository contains the hands-on exercises and code samples from a comprehensive workshop on **Terraform and AWS**. The workshop covers fundamental to advanced topics in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform, along with practical implementations on AWS.

## Workshop Modules

### 1. Introduction to Terraform and AWS

- Get acquainted with the fundamentals of **Terraform** and **AWS**.
- Connect your AWS instance with Terraform and deploy a basic **EC2 instance**.
- Understand the core principles of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and its significance in modern cloud environments.

### 2. Setting up Terraform with AWS

- Learn about the importance of **Terraform state** and how to leverage AWS cloud for state storage.
- Securely store credentials in AWS and retrieve them using Terraform.

### 3. Writing Terraform Configurations

- Explore **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** and write real-world Terraform configurations.
- Use **variables and outputs** in infrastructure code to manage AWS resources.
- Create **Terraform modules** for reusable and scalable infrastructure.

### 4. Managing Terraform State

- Understand the significance of **state management** in Terraform.
- Utilize **remote state storage**, state locking, state migration, and resolve state conflicts.
- Follow best practices in managing and securing Terraform state files.

### 5. Advanced Terraform Features

- Implement **workspaces** to manage multiple environments efficiently.
- Leverage **data sources and provisioners** to enhance Terraform capabilities.

### 6. Automating AWS Deployments with Terraform

- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** on AWS using Terraform.
- Automate application deployment on **Elastic Beanstalk** using **AWS CodePipeline** and Terraform configurations.

### 7. Troubleshooting and Debugging Terraform Configurations

- Learn best practices for troubleshooting common Terraform issues.
- Understand error messages, logging, and debugging techniques to maintain configurations efficiently.

### 8. Final Project: Deploying Secure EC2 Instances with a Shared RDS Database

- Apply everything learned in a comprehensive **final project**.
- Deploy secure **EC2 instances** sharing a centralized **RDS database**.
